# Refine Event Recurrence Logic

**Type:** enhancement
**Labels:** enhancement, backend
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** Done

## Description
The current event scheduling system allows for highly recurrent events, which users have indicated can clutter their calendars and reduce the effectiveness of event management. This task aims to implement changes that significantly reduce the default or maximum recurrence frequency for events. This might involve adjusting backend logic, modifying default values for recurrence intervals (e.g., shifting default from daily to weekly, or weekly to monthly), or introducing more prominent less frequent options in user controls. The goal is to make events appear less often by default, while still allowing for necessary recurrence patterns, thereby improving overall user experience and clarity.

**Stellar Miner interpretation:** Game events (Meteor Storm, Solar Flare, etc.) were firing every 2 min. Recurrence is driven by `gameConfig.timing` (eventIntervalMs, firstEventDelayMs, minEventDelayMs) and the game loop in `game.ts`. No calendar UI; defaults in config were refined.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Investigate current event recurrence settings and logic (catalogs + game loop).
- [x] Determine optimal less frequent default recurrence intervals (5 min between events, 1 min first delay, 2 min after load).
- [x] Implement changes to update default recurrence values in `gameConfig.json`.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [x] Investigate current event recurrence settings and logic.
- [x] Determine optimal less frequent default recurrence intervals.
- [x] Implement changes to update default recurrence values in config.
- [x] Add unit tests for event recurrence constants (catalogs.test.ts).
- [x] Typecheck and full test suite pass.

## Notes
Completed 2026-02. eventIntervalMs 120000→300000, firstEventDelayMs 25000→60000, minEventDelayMs 60000→120000.
