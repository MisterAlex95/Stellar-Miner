# Implement 3 New Skill-Based Quest Types

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, backend
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** Done

## Description
Currently, quest objectives could benefit from more diversity and skill-based challenges. This task involves designing and implementing at least three new quest types that introduce more engaging gameplay mechanics. Examples include achieving a 'Mega Combo', discovering a planet in a new star system, or surviving consecutive negative in-game events. These new quests should leverage existing game mechanics where possible and be integrated into the current quest generation and tracking system, aiming for increased player engagement and memorability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define specific conditions and requirements for 'Achieve Mega Combo', 'Discover New System Planet', and 'Survive X Events' quest types.
- [x] Update `QuestDefinition` and associated data models (e.g., `questState.ts` QuestType) to support new quest types.
- [x] Develop backend services/modules to track progress for each new quest type based on game events.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [ ] Define specific conditions and requirements for 'Achieve Mega Combo', 'Discover New System Planet', and 'Survive X Events' quest types.
- [ ] Update `QuestDefinition` and associated data models (e.g., `quest.types.ts`) to support new quest types.
- [ ] Develop backend services/modules to track progress for each new quest type based on game events.
- [ ] Integrate new quest types into the quest generation and reward assignment system.
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new quest logic and tracking mechanisms.
