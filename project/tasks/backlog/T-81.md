# Display discovered module set bonuses (log / archive)

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, ui
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** inbox

## Description
Add a way for players to review which module set bonuses they have already unlocked (discovered), so they can remember and plan. Option: a sub-tab or section in Archive (e.g. log / Sets / …) listing discovered sets with their bonus and possibly where/when first seen.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Persist or derive which set bonuses have ever been active for the player (discovered).
- [ ] Add a dedicated view to display discovered set bonuses (e.g. sub-tab in Archive, or Log/Sets).
- [ ] Display shows set name/description and bonus percent; optional: planet type condition, first-unlock hint.

## Dependencies
None (module set bonuses already implemented in T-76).

## Checklist
- [ ] Define how to track “discovered” set bonuses (e.g. add to save or derive from narratorShown / first activation).
- [ ] Add Archive sub-tab or Log/Sets section and wire to discovered sets data.
- [ ] Render list of discovered sets with bonus info (and optional planet type / first-seen).
- [ ] Bump version in `package.json` and add changelog entry in `src/data/changelog.json` (before marking task done).

## Notes
Consider reusing narrator “first time” logic or a dedicated discoveredSetIds in save. UI could live under Codex/Archive as “Sets” or “Module sets” to keep progression and logs in one place.
