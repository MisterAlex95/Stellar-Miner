# Implement Expedition Types

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, backend
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** next-up

## Description
Currently, the game features a single generic 'expedition' type. To deepen strategic gameplay and make crew/planet decisions more engaging, we need to introduce 2-3 distinct expedition types. Examples include 'Scout' (fast, low data return), 'Mining' (longer duration, high research data), and 'Rescue' (mission to recover lost crew). Each type will have unique attributes impacting success rates, resource yields, and crew risks, providing players with more meaningful choices before launching an expedition.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define attributes for 3 expedition types (e.g., Scout, Mining, Rescue) including duration, data output, crew risk, and success conditions.
- [ ] Update backend data models and database schema to store expedition type configurations.
- [ ] Implement game logic to process expedition outcomes based on the selected type and associated attributes.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [ ] Define attributes for 3 expedition types (e.g., Scout, Mining, Rescue) including duration, data output, crew risk, and success conditions.
