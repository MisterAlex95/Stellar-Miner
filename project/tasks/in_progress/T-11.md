# Show event duration on first occurrence

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, ui, narrative
**Effort:** 1 points
**Status:** next-up

## Description
First time an event type is seen, show a short tooltip that explains the effect and adds a bit of lore, e.g. *"Meteor Storm: 2× production for 30 s. The belt rains ore—strike while the sky burns."* So players learn what each event does and get a touch of atmosphere without reading a doc.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] First occurrence of each event type shows a one-line explanation (duration/effect).
- [ ] Optional lore/flavor line is shown with the explanation (from events.json or strings).
- [ ] Event types seen are tracked (e.g. in save or localStorage).
- [ ] Tooltip or toast uses data from events.json or strings.

## Dependencies
None (optional: align with T-15 event flavor field if present)

## Checklist
- [ ] Add eventTypesSeen (or equivalent) to save or localStorage.
- [ ] On event trigger, if new type, show one-line explanation + optional lore.
- [ ] Source mechanic text and lore from events config (e.g. `flavor`) or strings.

## Notes
From docs/ideas/backlog.md — Proposed gameplay improvements #8. Lore aligns with narrative ideas (e.g. T-15 event flavor).
