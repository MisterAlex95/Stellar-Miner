# Integrate Tailwind CSS for Styling

**Type:** enhancement
**Labels:** enhancement, frontend
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** Done

## Description
This task focuses on integrating Tailwind CSS into the project's frontend architecture. The primary goal is to convert all existing custom CSS rules and styles to Tailwind utility classes. It is crucial to ensure that the application's visual appearance and layout remain 100% identical to the current state post-migration. This involves a complete overhaul of CSS management, eliminating legacy CSS where Tailwind can provide an equivalent.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS and its PostCSS dependencies within the project.
- [x] Analyze existing CSS for common design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) to populate Tailwind's `tailwind.config.js` theme.
- [x] Migrate global CSS styles (e.g., base typography, resets) to Tailwind's `@layer base` or equivalent utility classes.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS and its PostCSS dependencies within the project.
- [x] Analyze existing CSS for common design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) to populate Tailwind's `tailwind.config.js` theme.
- [x] Migrate global CSS styles (e.g., base typography, resets) to Tailwind's `@layer base` or equivalent utility classes.
- [x] Convert all component-specific CSS styles to Tailwind utility classes, updating relevant components (e.g., in `components` folder).
- [x] Thoroughly test and visually verify consistency across all pages and components against the pre-migration state.
- [x] Remove all redundant legacy CSS files, modules, and declarations after successful migration and verification.
