# Enhance Search Tree UI with 3D Visualization

**Type:** enhancement
**Labels:** enhancement, ui
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** next-up

design-stop: pending

## Description
Rework the existing search tree component to provide a more visually appealing and interactive experience. Leverage three.js and potentially HTML Canvas to create a dynamic, stylized representation similar to the skill tree in 'Path of Exile'. The goal is to move beyond a basic, static tree structure to a more immersive and aesthetically pleasing visualization that enhances user engagement and navigation within complex search results or structured data. This improvement will make the search tree feel more modern and premium, aligning with project goals for high-quality UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research and define visual style inspired by 'Path of Exile' skill tree.
- [ ] Evaluate three.js/Canva for feasibility and create a basic 3D prototype for node visualization.
- [ ] Develop a new `SearchTree3D` component to replace the existing search tree UI.

## Dependencies
None
