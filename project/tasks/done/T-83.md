# Enhance Science Tree for Coherent Unlocks

**Type:** enhancement
**Labels:** enhancement, backend
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** Done

## Description
The current science system lacks coherence and clear progression paths. Rework it to introduce distinct, logically interconnected branches. Implement a 'Crew' branch (e.g., unlock professions, boost efficiency, reduce crew costs), a 'Modules' branch (e.g., reduce slot/worker requirements, increase production, add planet-specific bonuses), and an 'Expeditions' branch (e.g., unlock types like Scout/Mining/Rescue, reduce costs/duration, increase rewards, unlock new solar systems). Ensure unlocks are well-distributed across the entire tree and have clear dependencies across branches to improve player progression and strategic depth.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define the detailed structure and content for 'Crew' science branch.
- [x] Define the detailed structure and content for 'Modules' science branch.
- [x] Define the detailed structure and content for 'Expeditions' science branch.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [x] Define the detailed structure and content for 'Crew' science branch.
- [x] Define the detailed structure and content for 'Modules' science branch.
- [x] Define the detailed structure and content for 'Expeditions' science branch.
- [x] Map existing science unlocks and design new ones to fit the defined branches.
- [x] Establish logical dependencies and interconnections between all new science branches.
- [x] Implement the updated science tree logic and data structures in the backend.

## Notes
Completed: added branch field (core, crew, modules, expeditions) to schema and all nodes; Crew branch (5 nodes), Modules (rest), Expeditions (survey-systems + Faster Probes, Survival Training); branch-completion bonuses; docs updated.
