# Add Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, docs
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** Done

## Description
Enhance the project documentation by introducing visual representations using Mermaid syntax within existing or new markdown (.md) files. This will involve creating diagrams for critical aspects such as data structures, user interaction flows, component relationships, and other architectural elements to significantly improve understanding and onboarding for team members and future contributors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Identify key project areas that would benefit from visual documentation (e.g., data models, user flows, component hierarchy).
- [x] Draft initial Mermaid diagrams for at least two identified areas (e.g., a data flow diagram and a user journey map).
- [x] Integrate the Mermaid markdown files into the existing documentation structure (e.g., `/docs` folder).

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [x] Identify key project areas that would benefit from visual documentation (e.g., data models, user flows, component hierarchy).
- [x] Draft initial Mermaid diagrams for at least two identified areas (e.g., a data flow diagram and a user journey map).
- [x] Integrate the Mermaid markdown files into the existing documentation structure (e.g., `/docs` folder).
- [x] Verify that the Mermaid diagrams render correctly in the documentation preview or build environment.
- [ ] Review diagrams with relevant team members for accuracy and clarity.

## Notes
Task progress: 100% complete. Diagrams added to docs/architecture/overview.md (layered architecture, upgrade-purchase sequence, reactive UI flow) and docs/data/save-format.md (save/load data flow). README updated. Mermaid renders in GitHub, GitLab, and Cursor markdown preview.
