# Refine Event Recurrence Logic

**Type:** enhancement
**Labels:** enhancement, backend
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** next-up

## Description
The current event scheduling system allows for highly recurrent events, which users have indicated can clutter their calendars and reduce the effectiveness of event management. This task aims to implement changes that significantly reduce the default or maximum recurrence frequency for events. This might involve adjusting backend logic, modifying default values for recurrence intervals (e.g., shifting default from daily to weekly, or weekly to monthly), or introducing more prominent less frequent options in user controls. The goal is to make events appear less often by default, while still allowing for necessary recurrence patterns, thereby improving overall user experience and clarity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Investigate current event recurrence settings and logic in `events-service`.
- [ ] Determine optimal less frequent default recurrence intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly).
- [ ] Implement changes to update default recurrence values and options within the backend logic.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [ ] Investigate current event recurrence settings and logic in `events-service`.
- [ ] Determine optimal less frequent default recurrence intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly).
- [ ] Implement changes to update default recurrence values and options within the backend logic.
- [ ] Update relevant UI components (e.g., `EventForm.vue`) to reflect new default recurrence options or display options more clearly.
- [ ] Add or update unit and integration tests for event recurrence logic.
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing for event creation, editing, and recurrence saving.
