# Add Chronicle (journey log)

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, narrative
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** Done

## Description
Append-only log of key first-time moments (first upgrade, first planet, first prestige). Application: chronicle array in save — { date, eventId, sentence } per type; one narrative sentence per event. Presentation: "Chronicle" or "History" in Stats — scrollable list. Sentences can be generated from a small template map in code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Chronicle entries are appended on first upgrade, first planet, first prestige, etc.
- [x] Chronicle is persisted in save and shown in Stats (Chronicle/History section).
- [x] Each entry has date, eventId, and a short sentence.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [x] Add chronicle array to save and append logic in handlers.
- [x] Define sentence templates for each event type.
- [x] Add Chronicle/History view in Stats with scrollable list.

## Notes
Implemented via Codex/Archive: codexUnlocks with { id, at } in save; Archive tab shows ship-log view (chronological log with [time], category, title, body). Unlocks on first upgrade, first planet, first prestige, achievements, events, etc. Same feature; log lives in Archive tab instead of Stats section.
