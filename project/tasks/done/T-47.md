# Offline earnings breakdown (game)

**Epic:** E-Game - Board engagement
**Type:** feature
**Effort:** 1 point
**Status:** Done

## Description
After load: "You earned X coins while away (Y hours)." Transparency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] When offline earnings are applied on load, user sees breakdown: coins earned and duration away (e.g. "2h 15m").
- [x] Shown in toast or small Dashboard/Stats line; not blocking.
- [x] Strings (en/fr).

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [x] SaveLoadService already computes offline coins; pass duration and amount to UI.
- [x] Add display and strings.
- [x] Bump version in `package.json` and add changelog entry in `src/data/changelog.json` (before marking task done).

## Notes
Already implemented: showOfflineToast(coins, capped, hours), welcomeBackWithHours/welcomeBackCappedWithHours in domainToasts; game.ts calls after load. From docs/board-enhancement-ideas.md — Stellar Miner game idea #12.
