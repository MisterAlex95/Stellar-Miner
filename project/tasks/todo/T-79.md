**Status:** next-up

design-stop: pending

## Description
Integrate a dynamic display indicating the estimated time remaining until the next significant progression goal. This includes either 'Prochain upgrade dans ~X min' or 'Prochaine planète dans ~Y min'. The calculation must be based on the player's current production rate and the cost of the upcoming upgrade or planet. This feature aims to provide continuous feedback on player progress, allowing users to understand their advancement towards key milestones without needing to consult external documentation or inventory screens. It should be presented visibly on the main game interface, distinct from existing quest logs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design UI placement and format for the ETA display component.
- [ ] Develop backend logic to calculate ETA for next upgrade/planet based on current production rate.
- [ ] Create a frontend component to fetch and display the calculated ETA dynamically.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
