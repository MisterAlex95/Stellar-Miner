**Status:** inbox

## Description
When a random event is about to trigger, show a short choice: "Accept" (normal) or "Skip" (no bonus, no risk). Optionally later: "Double or nothing" (2× effect or cancel). Adds a small decision without changing balance much.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Before an event starts, player can choose Accept or Skip.
- [ ] Skip cancels the event with no bonus and no risk.
- [ ] UI shows the choice in a non-intrusive way (toast or small modal).

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [ ] Add event choice state and handler before applying event effect.
- [ ] Implement Skip path (no effect, no penalty).
- [ ] Add UI for Accept/Skip (and optionally Double later).
- [ ] Ensure choice is clear and does not block gameplay long.
