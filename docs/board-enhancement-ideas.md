# Stellar Miner – Game Board / Engagement Ideas

Ideas to make the **game** (dashboard, tabs, mine, empire, quests, achievements, prestige, etc.) more engaging. "Board" = main game UI and player engagement.

---

## 1. Visual design & feedback

| # | Idea | Brief description | Potential benefit |
|---|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Animated tab badges** | Subtle pulse or glow when a tab has an action (quest claimable, affordable upgrade, prestige ready). | Draws attention without being noisy. |
| 2 | **Dashboard "recommended next" prominence** | Bigger card or icon for the suggested next step (upgrade, quest, expedition, prestige). | Reduces "what do I do?" for new players. |
| 3 | **Progress toward next milestone** | Small bar or ring on Mine or Dashboard: "X% to next milestone (Y coins)." | Clear short-term goal. |
| 4 | **Combo meter animation** | More satisfying visual/audio feedback when combo tier increases. | Rewards active mining. |
| 5 | **Theme-aware accents** | Planet/star colors or Empire visuals adapt slightly to light/dark theme. | Cohesive feel. |
| 6 | **Compact/expanded stats** | Toggle in Stats tab between compact list and detailed view. | Suits different preferences. |
| 7 | **Celebration on achievement unlock** | Short confetti or flash when an achievement unlocks. | Makes progress feel rewarding. |

## 2. Progress & metrics

| # | Idea | Brief description | Potential benefit |
|---|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 8 | **Session summary on load** | "Last time you earned X coins" or "You were away 2h; +Y offline coins." | Context and continuity. |
| 9 | **Next milestone countdown** | Dashboard line: "Z coins until next milestone (1M)." | Clear target. |
| 10 | **Quest streak indicator** | Flame or icon with current streak level visible in Empire/Dashboard. | Reinforces streak mechanic. |
| 11 | **Prestige gain always visible** | Small breakdown (level + planets + research = total %) in Empire, not only in modal. | Constant motivation. |
| 12 | **Offline earnings breakdown** | After load: "You earned X coins while away (Y hours)." | Transparency. |
| 13 | **Production trend** | Up/down vs previous session or "yesterday" (if we track it). | Sense of progression. |

## 3. Gamification & motivation

| # | Idea | Brief description | Potential benefit |
|---|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 14 | **Daily login streak** | Consecutive calendar days with at least one session; optional mulligan. | Encourages return. |
| 15 | **Achievement progress bars** | In Achievements modal: "47/100 clicks toward X." | Visible progress to next unlock. |
| 16 | **Easter egg achievements** | Hidden achievements (e.g. click 100 times in 10s, find a secret). | Discovery and fun. |
| 17 | **Mini goals** | Optional "Reach 10K coins this run" with small reward. | Short-term targets. |
| 18 | **Confetti or effect on prestige** | Celebratory animation when confirming prestige. | Milestone feel. |
| 19 | **Sound categories** | Toggle mining / UI / celebration sounds separately. | Accessibility and preference. |

## 4. Interaction & navigation

| # | Idea | Brief description | Potential benefit |
|---|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 20 | **Swipe or keyboard between tabs** | On one-page layout: swipe or 1–6 keys to switch tab. | Faster navigation. |
| 21 | **Claim-all for bonuses** | If daily + offline (or multiple) available, one "Claim all" action. | Fewer clicks. |
| 22 | **Long-press upgrade for quick info** | Tooltip or popover with formula/cost without opening detail. | Quick reference. |
| 23 | **Formula tooltips** | Hover on production/crew cost to see formula. | Transparency for number lovers. |
| 24 | **Quest deep-link to tab** | Quest text links to relevant tab (e.g. "Buy upgrade" → Upgrades). | Reduces hunting. |
| 25 | **Remember last tab** | Restore last active tab on next load (optional). | Continuity. |

---

## 5. Content & depth

| # | Idea | Brief description | Potential benefit |
|---|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 26 | **More quest types** | e.g. Clicks, Spend (already proposed in backlog), Research nodes, Combo tier. | Variety. |
| 27 | **Planet discovery flavor** | Expand first-contact text per planet type (already have discovery log). | Narrative. |
| 28 | **Prestige lore expansion** | More lore lines or chapters per prestige level (already have prestigeLore). | Long-term narrative. |
| 29 | **Codex triggers for events** | Unlock Codex entries when certain events are seen. | Connects codex to events. |
| 30 | **Crew/role snippets in Codex** | Unlock short backstory per role or veteran. | World-building. |
| 31 | **Research node lore** | Short description or lore per research node. | Depth in research tree. |

## 6. Polish & accessibility

| # | Idea | Brief description | Potential benefit |
|---|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 32 | **Reduced motion everywhere** | Ensure all new animations respect reducedMotion setting. | Accessibility. |
| 33 | **Export stats** | Button to copy stats (or JSON) for sharing or backup. | Power users. |
| 34 | **What's new highlight** | Changelog entry for current version highlighted in modal. | Onboarding after update. |
| 35 | **First-run onboarding** | Optional tooltip sequence for first run (Mine → Dashboard → Empire). | New player guidance. |
