# Migrate CSS to Tailwind & Refactor Frontend

**Type:** enhancement
**Labels:** enhancement, frontend
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** Done

## Description
This task involves a significant refactoring of our frontend codebase. The primary goal is to migrate all existing custom CSS rules and classes into Tailwind CSS utility classes, enhancing consistency and development speed. Additionally, a thorough review of the codebase is required to identify and remove duplicated code blocks, consolidating them into reusable components or helper functions. This initiative aims to improve maintainability, reduce bundle size, and streamline future development, aligning with our CPM Kanban Board project's long-term technical debt reduction goals.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Identify key CSS files/components for Tailwind migration
- [x] Convert existing custom CSS rules to Tailwind utility classes
- [x] Extract duplicated code snippets into reusable components or utilities

## Dependencies
