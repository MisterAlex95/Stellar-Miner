# Add quest claim countdown

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, ui
**Effort:** 1 points
**Status:** inbox

## Description
In Empire, next to the quest Claim button, show "Claim within 4:32" (or a small progress ring) so the 5-minute claim window is visible. Reuse QUEST_CLAIM_WINDOW_MS and quest state; update every second when quest is done and not yet claimed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] When quest is complete and unclaimed, UI shows time left to claim (e.g. "Claim within 4:32").
- [ ] Countdown updates at least every second and uses QUEST_CLAIM_WINDOW_MS.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [ ] Expose claim window end from quest state.
- [ ] Add countdown display next to Claim button; update every second.

## Notes
From docs/ideas/backlog.md — QOL #4.
