# Implement Module Set Bonuses

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, backend
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** next-up

## Description
Develop and integrate a system for module set bonuses. When a specific number of identical modules are placed on the same planet, a predefined bonus (e.g., +5% production) is activated. This feature aims to enhance gameplay depth by making module placement more strategic and offering players clear short-term goals to complete sets. The bonuses should be configurable and clearly visible in the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define data structures and configurations for module set bonuses (e.g., `ModuleSetBonusType`).
- [ ] Develop backend logic to detect completed module sets on a planet.
- [ ] Implement game state logic to apply and remove active set bonuses and their effects.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [ ] Define data structures and configurations for module set bonuses (e.g., `ModuleSetBonusType`).
- [ ] Develop backend logic to detect completed module sets on a planet.
- [ ] Implement game state logic to apply and remove active set bonuses and their effects.
- [ ] Integrate calculated set bonuses into relevant game mechanics (e.g., production calculations).
- [ ] Design and implement frontend UI elements to display potential and active set bonuses to players.
