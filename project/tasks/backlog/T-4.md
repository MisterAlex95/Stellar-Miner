# Add quest types: Clicks and Spend

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, quests
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** backlog

## Description
Introduce two new quest types: "Clicks" (e.g. make 50 clicks in 2 minutes) to reward active play using existing combo/click tracking, and "Spend" (e.g. spend 1,000 coins in one run) by tracking `totalSpentThisRun` (reset on prestige) to reward big purchases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicks quest type is defined and generated (e.g. "Make N clicks in M minutes").
- [ ] Spend quest type is defined; totalSpentThisRun is tracked and reset on prestige.
- [ ] Both types integrate with existing quest UI and claim flow.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [ ] Add quest type definitions and generation for Clicks and Spend.
- [ ] Implement totalSpentThisRun in game state and reset on prestige.
- [ ] Wire quest completion checks for both types.
- [ ] Add or extend strings for new quest descriptions.
