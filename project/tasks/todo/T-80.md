## Description
Integrate short narrative phrases for player's first encounters with key game events such as discovering a gas giant, experiencing a lost expedition, or encountering a significant negative event. This aims to enrich the player's progression and immersion by leveraging existing lore and tooltips. Additionally, explore the creation of new or expansion of existing Codex entries related to these first discoveries to provide deeper context and lore, making the game world feel more alive and responsive to player actions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define specific 'first discovery' event triggers (e.g., first gas giant, first lost expedition, first negative event).
- [ ] Author concise narrative phrases (1-2 sentences) for each identified first discovery event.
- [ ] Implement a system to track and store which 'first discovery' events have occurred for the current player/save.
