# Refine .gitignore configuration

**Type:** enhancement
**Labels:** enhancement, backend
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** Done

## Description
The .gitignore file needs to be reviewed and updated to prevent unnecessary files and directories from being committed to the repository. This includes build artifacts, temporary files, IDE-specific configurations, and other generated content that doesn't belong in version control. A clean .gitignore helps maintain repository hygiene, reduces repository size, and ensures consistent development environments by excluding irrelevant items. The goal is to ensure only essential source code and configuration files are tracked for the CPM Kanban Board project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Identify and list common unnecessary files/folders (e.g., node_modules, dist, .env, IDE configs) within the project structure.
- [x] Review the existing .gitignore file for any missing patterns or redundant rules.
- [x] Add new exclusion patterns to .gitignore for all identified unnecessary files and directories.

## Dependencies
None

- [x] Add new exclusion patterns to .gitignore for all identified unnecessary files and directories.

- [ ] Commit the updated .gitignore file to the repository.
