# Implement Player Choice for Events

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, ui
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** next-up

design-stop: pending

## Description
Currently, all in-game events are purely random (RNG). This task aims to introduce player choices for a subset of these events. Instead of an automatic outcome, players will be presented with options, such as "Risk 1 astronaut for x2 production for 30s" or "Do nothing." This adds a layer of player agency and strategic decision-making without completely redesigning the event system. The new choices should be integrated into the existing event display, offering clear options and consequences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define new data structures/types for events with player choices (e.g., ChoiceEvent).
- [ ] Develop a dedicated UI component to display event choices and capture player input.
- [ ] Implement backend logic to process selected choices and apply corresponding game effects.

## Dependencies
None
