# Add quest claim countdown

**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, ui
**Effort:** 1 points
**Status:** Done

## Description
In Empire, next to the quest Claim button, show "Claim within 4:32" (or a small progress ring) so the 5-minute claim window is visible. Reuse QUEST_STREAK_WINDOW_MS and quest state; update every second when quest is done and not yet claimed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] When quest is complete and unclaimed, UI shows time left to claim (e.g. "Claim within 4:32").
- [x] Countdown updates at least every second and uses QUEST_STREAK_WINDOW_MS.

## Dependencies
None

## Checklist
- [x] Expose claim window end from quest state.
- [x] Add countdown display next to Claim button; update every second.
- [x] Bump version in `package.json` and add changelog entry in `src/data/changelog.json` (before marking task done).

## Notes
From docs/ideas/backlog.md — QOL #4. Use QUEST_STREAK_WINDOW_MS from catalogs (5 min claim window).
