**Type:** feature
**Labels:** feature, ui
**Effort:** 2 points
**Status:** Done

## Description
Upon initiating a prestige event, the player will be presented with a set of mutually exclusive, persistent bonus choices for the upcoming run. This choice aims to provide unique strategic variations and a distinct identity for each new run. Examples include bonuses like "+10% Click Production for this run," "+10% Total Production," or "Expedition Speed +15%." The selected bonus will be applied immediately and persist until the next prestige, influencing subsequent gameplay and encouraging different playstyles.
